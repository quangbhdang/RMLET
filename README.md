# RMIT MACHINE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (RMLET)
This template provides a flexible environment for machine learning and deep learning projects, tailored for RMIT coursework. It aims to streamline setup, encourage good practices, and support collaboration.

**Contents:**
1. [Quick Setup Guide](#quick-guide)
2. [Project Overview](#the-rant-about-the-project)

## QUICK-GUIDE

### Recommended: Anaconda/Miniconda Setup

Use Anaconda/Miniconda for consistent and easy environment management. Install Miniconda:

**Linux/MacOS:**
```sh
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3
rm miniconda.sh
```

**Windows:**
```sh
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe -o miniconda.exe
Start-Process .\miniconda.exe -ArgumentList "/S" -Wait
del miniconda.exe
```

> **Tip:** For Windows, WSL2 is recommended for better compatibility and GPU support. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

**Set up the environment:**
```sh
conda init
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate myenv
```
Install additional packages as needed. When finished, deactivate with `conda deactivate`. You can change the name of the environment by modify the name of the environment inside the envrionment.yml instead the default one.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Goals
- Provide a ready-to-use ML/AI project structure.
- Encourage clear, maintainable, and collaborative workflows.
- Support easy experiment tracking and reproducibility.

### Included Packages
- pandas (or polars)
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- JupyterLab

All packages are managed via `environment.yml`. Add more as needed.

**Recommended tools for advanced projects:**
- [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/) / [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) for experiment tracking.
- [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for data/model versioning.
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)) for reports.

### ML/DL Frameworks
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

Add these to `environment.yml` as needed.

### Folder Structure

```
data/             # Data storage (see subfolders below)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/          # Original, immutable data (save for sharing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interim/      # Intermediate data (generated by scripts, not shared)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/    # Cleaned/feature-engineered data (generated by scripts, not shared)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ final/        # Final datasets ready for modeling (save for sharing)
model/            # Model-related files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weights/      # Saved model weights/checkpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/      # Model configuration files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/         # Training logs and metrics
src/          # Source code
notebooks/    # Jupyter notebooks
report/       # LaTeX reports, references
environment.yml
```

**Note:** To save cloud space, only `data/raw/` and `data/final/` should be shared as it is. All other data (interim, processed) should be generated from scripts in `src/` or via a DVC pipeline. This way when you track your script on GIT it can be recreated by calling the specific script and rerun the pipeline. If you have multiple dataset separate them by adding the dataset name as subfolder for `src\$dataset_name` and `data\$dataset_name\*` as the following example:

```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mnist/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interim/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cifar10/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interim/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final/
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mnist/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... # Scripts for MNIST processing/modeling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cifar10/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... # Scripts for CIFAR-10 processing/modeling
```

This keeps code and data for each dataset separate, making your workflow cleaner and more reproducible.

- **Weeks 4‚Äì5:** Documentation, reporting, sharing results

Adjust the timeline as needed for longer or more complex projects. This workflow ensures clear collaboration, reproducibility, and easy tracking of experiments and results.

**Tip 1:** Test the environment early with sample data/code to ensure all team members can run the project. This make a wold different when dealing with massive dataset or audio, visual datasets.

**Tip 2:** It a good idea to create a [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/) that combine all script into a single command in CLI for simpler and consistent process when working with more complex project or multiple tools.

**Tip 3:** For long running session a push notification tool is extremly helpful to allow for your to check on your code running status without having to physically be on your notebook or script. [Ntfy](https://docs.ntfy.sh/), have a self-host version, or [Pushover](https://pushover.net/), os license one-time payment, are two option I highly recommend.

**Tip 4:** You can turn your home pc into a Colab like server using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) plus a remote desktop program like [Rustdesk](https://rustdesk.com/). Tailscale streamline you VPN setting allow you to easily securly serve our MLFlow, or Jupyter Lab without exposing our network in a unsecure manner. Rustdesk help you run these service remotely without worry about SSH session timeout. 

**Tip 5:** Use Tailscale serve (Funnel) option to open up your MLflow server for remote tracking. You should secure MLflow server using basic authentication, beta support as current speaking, or custom authentication prior to do this. But in exchange you can now switch between different machine or VM instance with more powerful GPU while still having the run output store directly on your system. WARNING: do ensure you have data backup solution on your machine as you don't have the benefit of cloud or enterprise level backup on local machine.
