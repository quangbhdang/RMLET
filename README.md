# RMIT MACHINE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (RMLET)
This is a template for a machine learning, deep learning project based on the requirements for coursework at RMIT University.
The idea is to create a flexible template environment that caters to multiple machine learning, deep learning, and AI development projects.

## Why this GitHub repository was created
When starting in machine learning, and data science I was stumped as to where to begin my project. In most online material and even at my university the material is often skipped over the setting of the environment and the workspace of the project in favour of rapid prototyping and general theory.

While this might work for smaller projects or early introduction to machine learning concepts this quickly becomes a hurdle for more advanced courses and practice projects where complex functions and libraries need to be maintained.

This often results in a janky way in which I have to keep track of parameters, experiments result in separate Excel sheets and multiple files just to keep track of my project and collaborate with my peers.

## Goal of this project
1. Create an environment where ML and AI student can quickly use to set up their project.
2. The project repo is clear, well defined and allows for good programming practice.
3. Give a high level of flexibility so it can be further developed into a more complex project.
